Build: Go to the hamming dir, type make, the executables will be placed to the HeIvIndex dir.


plug in the data, follow the pipeline:

(1) put all ukbench images under data/Images

(2) put all extracted feature files under data/Images, the format of the feature file follow CSV (space separated)

(3) sh sample.sh, construct the training data for kmeans

(4) python genProjectMatrix.py, construct the projection matrix for hamming embedding 

(5) ./kmeans, build the codebook

(6) ./he_medians, construct the median mat for hamming embedding

(7) ./he_quantize, do a batch quantization for all images, feature paths are listed in data/featlist

(8) ./he_query > query.txt, do a batch query for all images, feature paths are listed in data/featlist

(9) python computeNSScore.py, to compute the NS score 

Note:

(1) A lot of files are pre-loaded, I have not checked the read error, e.g., the file doesnot exist

(2) All the generated files are put in the data dir
